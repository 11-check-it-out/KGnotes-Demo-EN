# Definition

"Parental psychological control is one of the invasive parenting styles, often manifested by the use of intrusive psychological control strategies (e.g. devaluation, triggering guilt, stopping the expression of love for the child, etc.) to manage and control the child (Fang Chao, 2019)" [@jiang2022fumuxinlikon, p. 1]

'Parental psychological control is a form of intrusive parenting in which parents manipulate children's emotions, thoughts and emotional connections between parents and children by triggering feelings of guilt or anxiety, withdrawing love, etc., and limiting children's self-development and self-expression' [@xing2017fumuxinlikon, p. 1]

'Parental psychological control refers to parents' attempts to control young people's behaviour by controlling their emotions, thoughts and parent-child relationships' [@wang2013fumukongzhiy, p. 811]

But I think these definitions are .......
